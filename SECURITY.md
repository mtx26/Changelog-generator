## Reporting a Vulnerability

Although this project does not yet have specific security versions, we encourage the community to report any potential vulnerabilities.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please report it privately through one of the following methods:

1. **Create a private issue**: If you are a collaborator on the project, you can open a **private issue** to report the vulnerability.

2. **Contact us directly**: If you are not a collaborator, you can email [mtx_26@outlook.be](mailto:mtx_26@outlook.be). We will respond as soon as possible.

3. **Response Time**: Due to our limited availability, responses may take some time. We kindly ask for your patience.

### What Happens After Reporting a Vulnerability

We cannot guarantee a specific timeline for resolving vulnerabilities at this stage, but we will do our best to address the reports responsibly. Reported vulnerabilities will be evaluated and, if possible, fixed in a future version.

**Note:** We encourage users to regularly check for updates and changes related to the project's security management.
